The angles correspond to those typically used for solar installations in Edmonton. Each of the six modules is paired with a duplicate module placed at exactly the same angle. During the winter months, snow will be cleared from the left side of the modules. By pairing modules at exactly the same angles, researchers will be able to compare the effect of snow clearing versus snow cover on energy production.\r\n\r\nThe degree angle of rows are 90, 53, 45, 27, 18, 14 degree. You can find the actual picture at the \"About\" tab. In the dataset column name, 90_LEFT means the left panel and 90 degree angle and so on.\r\n\r\nThe City is not the owner of this data, it is provided to us and owned by NAIT",

These collections are from standard New Jersey light traps that are commonly used to record changes in abundance of mosquitoes before and after control campaigns and to compare seasonal and annual fluctuations in population.  Since not all mosquito species are attracted equally to light traps, the City uses a variety of other trapping and survey methods (with their own limitations) to monitor mosquitoes. Not all trap collection sites are factored into the historical averages. Some data can be incomplete due to trap failure. Some trap locations change over time. Trap collections reflect, not absolute population levels, but mosquito activity, which is influenced by changing environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.). The weekly averages do not include any male mosquitoes or any females of species that do not typically bite people. Each data set reflects the mosquito activity of the week previous to the collection date.

Adjustments are based on variations by time of year measured at permanent count locations that monitor traffic year round.\r\n\r\nYear to Year Volume Changes \u2010 Interpretation of Results\r\nAn increase or decrease in volume does not necessarily indicate a trend for a given roadway. Some areas may record a temporary change in volume due to the reconstruction of a roadway link. Although every attempt is made to avoid counting areas while diversions are in effect, some roadway projects affect traffic patterns for a long period of time and are reflected in the counts. For example, the 2011 construction program included Scona Road, the interchange at 23 Avenue/Gateway Boulevard, widening of the Quesnell Bridge, overpasses for major links of the West Anthony Henday, and interchanges for the north Anthony Henday.",

    "name": "Midblock Collision Summary (2010 - 2011)",
    "description": "This file contains information about all midblock segments (portions of roadway that exist between intersections) in Edmonton with 10 or more collisions for the year 2010 to 2011, including:\r\n- The collision rate, where available;\r\n- A summary of the number of minor and major injuries as well as fatalities;\r\n- A breakdown of collisions by the standard list of causes used in reporting\r\n\r\nCollision information is provided by the Motor Vehicle Collision Information System (MVCIS), maintained by the City of Edmonton Office of Traffic Safety. This system tracks police-reported collisions involving at least one motor vehicle that occur on public roadways and which result in property damage of $1,000 or more, as well as any collisions resulting in injury or fatality. \r\n\r\nThis file is meant as a companion piece to the 2010 Annual Collision Report, produced by the City of Edmonton Office of Traffic Safety. Please refer to the full report for more information on collisions in Edmonton, and definitions of the collision causes and injury types used in this file.  \r\n.\r\n\r\nCollision Locations\r\nMidblock collision locations are usually descibed as being north of or west of an intersection. For example, Whitemud Drive west of 122 Street encompasses all of Whitemud Drive from west of 122 Street (not including the intersections at 122 Street) to the Terwillegar Drive interchange. Generally, a midblock is defined from one intersection to the next intersection with a public roadway. Midblocks in interchanges are defined by their description in the spreadsheet that follows.",

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments.",

During the winter months, snow will be cleared from the left side of the modules. By pairing modules at exactly the same angles, researchers will be able to compare the effect of snow clearing versus snow cover on energy production. The degree angle of rows are 90, 53, 45, 27, 18, 14 degrees. You can find the actual picture at the \"About\" tab.

With changes being made to collection of federal census data, consistent collection of municipal census data will be the most reliable source of comparative data available to the City of Edmonton.  Current census data will also allow the City to maximize per capita grants provided by the provincial and federal governments.",

Citizens can volunteer to plant in these areas through the Root for Trees program.\r\n\r\nFor more information on naturalization visit edmonton.ca/naturalization.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to get involved in tree planting visit www.rootfortrees.ca.",

    "description": "The goal of this Climate Perception Baseline Survey was to research and better understand the current perceptions and behaviours of Edmontonians around climate change. This survey provided a baseline for the City of Edmonton to measure perception, awareness and likelihood that a citizen will take part in climate-related initiatives such as the City's EnerGuide for Homes program.\r\n\r\nThis survey was done by Leger - The Research Intelligence Group in June 2017 on behalf of the City of Edmonton.\r\n\r\nThis dataset consists of the survey results data. In addition, descriptions of the columns in this dataset, the survey questionnaire, and the final report produced based on this data  are included as attachments to this dataset.",
